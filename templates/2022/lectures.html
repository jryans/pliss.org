                        In these lectures, I will focus on the problem of
                        compile-time scheduling optimizations that restructure
                        computations to improve locality and parallelims.
                        Traditional approaches to this problem reason about
                        loop structures and schedules in terms of polyhedra,
                        but there has been little success in extending such
                        approaches beyond loop-based programs. I will start by
                        briefly introducing the basic concepts used in
                        reasoning about and transforming loop programs. I will
                        then argue that there are interesting scheduling
                        transformations that can be done for nonâ€“loop based
                        programs, in particular recursive traversla programs
                        such as those that arise in graphics, data mining, and
                        simulation. I will survey recent work from the last
                        decade on designing and implementing these
                        transformations. Then, I will discuss recent advances
                        in developing unified frameworks for representing,
                        reasoning about, and transforming programs that deal
                        with loops and recursion. Time permitting, we will also
                        use one of these frameworks to explore and design a new
                        transformation for recursive programs.
